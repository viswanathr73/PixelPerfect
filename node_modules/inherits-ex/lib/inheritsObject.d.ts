 * Sets the prototype of an object to a new prototype, and inherits from a given class.

 * make sure the aClass.prototype hook to the aObject instance.

 * @param {Object} aObject - The object whose prototype needs to be set.
 * @param {Function} aClass - The class to inherit from.
 * @param {boolean} staticInherit - Whether to inherit static properties or not.
 * @returns {boolean} - Whether the prototype was successfully set or not.
 * @example
 * ```js
 * class Person {
 *   constructor(name) {
 *     this.name = name;
 *   }
 *
 *   sayHello() {
 *     console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);

 *
 * const john = new Person('John');
 * const jane = {name: 'Jane'};
 *
 * // make object Inherit from Person
 * inheritsObject(jane, Person);
 *
 * // Now jane's prototype is Person, and she can call sayHello
 * jane.sayHello(); // logs "Hello, my name is Jane"
