 * Copies properties from one or more source objects to a target object.

 *
 * Only copies properties that are directly on the source object (not inherited).

 * @param {Object} target - The target object to copy properties to.
 * @param {...Object} sources - One or more source objects to copy properties from.
 * @returns {Object} The modified target object.
